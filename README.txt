#This Python script utilizes the ResNet50 pre-trained model to detect deepfake images.

#It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter for ease of use.

#Users can browse and select an image to determine if it's classified as "Fake" or "Real" based on the ResNet50 model's prediction.

#Step 1: Setup

Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install required libraries:
#Copy code:

pip install tkinter pillow tensorflow
Save the script with a .py extension, e.g., deepfake_detection.py.

#Step 2: Functionality

load_image(file_path): Loads and preprocesses the selected image.

predict_deepfake(file_path): Predicts whether the image contains a deepfake.

classify_image(prediction): Classifies prediction as "Fake" or "Real".

browse_image(): Opens a file dialog for image selection.
